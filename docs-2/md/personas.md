## Distribution Curve

On the low end, we have customers in trial experiencing the app for the first time and they are a single user with a single Twitter profile. On the high end, it is common for enterprise customers to have dozens of users and groups managing hundreds of profiles.

## Potential Real-Time Metrics

Single user accounts
Accounts with more than one user

Users with more than one group
